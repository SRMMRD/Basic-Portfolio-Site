# Basic-Portfolio-Site
Project to learn Web Dev. Basic portfolio setup

This project, while I admit is very basic is my first project in the direction of web development. It is a site that can be easily added to and changed based on need.
I want to add a lot more to this project and hope as time goes on and my skills develop it will be improved upon. I wanted something that I could use personally but also
something that could be taken and adapted as a sort of "template" as I have some friends that may want a website and I feel like this is easily accessed and customized to
fit peoples needs.


<b>CSS FEATURE 1</b>

The layout of the web page changes to fit all screens. I've tried to make it so the layout is basically the same during each media stage, to make it more consistent over
devices. The content changes placement just to show that I understand the principles of moving content.

<b>CSS FEATURE 2</b>

There is flexbox in the navigation bar that brings it close on mobile screen, turns it into a column on tablet screens and on large screens extends it all the way across
with hopfully even spacing.

<b>JAVASCRIPT FEATURE</b>

The Javascript interacts with the form in contact.html to take the data and validate it, to present in an alert to the user with an alert box which offers gratitude to them
for taking the time to submit the details and also read them back to the submitting party.
